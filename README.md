- 👋 Hi, I’m @MegaMoonBear  😄 Pronouns: She/Her (or They/Them)
- ⚡ Fun facts: I used to be a Japanese black bear researcher. (Related to that, I teach beginner Japanese, ecology, and STEAM Innovation with Varsity Tutors.)
- 👀 With my prior experience as a Data Analyst, I might focus on Python, SQL, &/or JavaScript to upskill to Data Scientist roles. What else should focus on?
- 🌱 I am an advanced novice for SQL, since I used in for socio-economic analytics at a school district. For 3.5 months, I've been learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Python.
